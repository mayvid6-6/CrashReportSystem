# CrashReportSystem
Have you looked at airplane blackboxes? They are super cool! They allow pilots, airplane manufacturers, and the FAA to learn from their mistakes. It turns a tragedy into a learning oppurtunity to ensure the same type of crash never happens again. Our team proposes doing the same with cars. There are thousands of car crashes and each one of them just becomes a sob story in the news. We want to end car crashes as we know them. From every car crash that our system detects it will get critical information to first responders. It also uploads information to a website available to everyone. Our neural networks will analyze every detail of the crash, for the gyroscope statistics to the gps location. Through this we will a ble to find helpful information about the crash. The idea has so many possiblities and we hope to make vehicle accidents a thing of the past.
