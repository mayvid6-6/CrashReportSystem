  <h1>Crash Research</h1>
  <p>We use a MPU6050 to detect the acceleration, temperature, and the rotation of the car in a crash. CrashBox also uses a GPS to find the current location in a crash to send to Emergency Services. When the sensors detect a crash we send a SMS to 911 and to friends and family with the location of the crash, what has happened in the crash (fire? Car has flipped?), the person's underlying health conditions and their vehicle make and model. The microcontroller also detects in what way the car is being rotated, its acceleration and temperature. Once one of those spikes is detected our code kicks in. All the relevant data gets sent as an SMS message to 911. After Emergency Services are notified the code uploads the information to our website that stores and processes all of the crash data.</p>

  <p>The only data we collect is the data we send to law enforcement and for research to prevent future accidents. No names or specific descriptions are given about crash victims. </p>
  <h2 id="About_Us" class='points'>About Us</h2>
  <p>We are a team of TJHSST student dedicated to making the world a safer and better place. We were inspired to make CrashBox because we thought that a lot of car crashes were similar or caused by similar problems. We wanted to give people a chance to not only learn from their mistakes but from the mistakes of others. This allows us to be smarter and safer drivers.</p>
